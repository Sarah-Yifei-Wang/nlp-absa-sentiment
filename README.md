The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)[1] within the Federal Reserve System is responsible for managing inflation, maximizing employment, and stabilizing interest rates. Meeting minutes play an impor- tant role for market movements because they provide the birdâ€™s eye view of how this eco- nomic complexity is constantly re-weighed. Therefore, There has been growing interest in analyzing and extracting sentiments on various aspects from large financial texts for economic projection. However, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is not widely used on financial data due to the lack of large labeled dataset. In this paper, I propose a model to train ABSA on financial documents under weak supervision and analyze its predictive power on various macroeconomic indicators.
